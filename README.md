--RUNNING APP--
To run this app, clone the git repo here: 

Once downloaded to local project, open terminal, cd to project directory, and execute 'npm start'

I wanted to create the app from scratch to refresh my memory on the process. Once created, I followed the README.md from the assignment to create the database instance.

--THOUGHT PROCCESS--
The first and only time I have used react/js was 2 years ago. I decided to give it a go in this assessment regardless for a couple reasons: 
1. My most immediate comfort framework/language is laravel/livewire/php, but easily having someone clone and run that repo is just too much.
2. I pride myself on being adaptable, so I figured it would be a good opporunity to show that.

The first thing I did was attempt to build the front-end components. When creating a "full" app, I like to visualize the final product (rougly) first because it helps me to understand the goal of the backend logic (where it's going and why). If whatever I'm working on doesn't have a front-end, I try to build/visualize whatever return item I'm looking for instead.

Since it's been awhile since using react and js, I decided to stick to keeping components as classees instead of functions. It was just easier for me coming freshly off php to use the class structure.

As time went on, I quickly realized my lack of expierence using these technologies was too much to overcome within 2 hours. Being transparanet, if I were to do this using more comfortale technologies I only invision myself getting a little further to where the components would be passing around dumby data.

I am confident that my "design" of this app and how the components, library, and api would work together is good and efficient. I still could have missed the mark, but it is the same "design" I would have built using more familiar technologies.

I researched the technologies for about 1 hour and then spent the next 2 hours designing and developing.
